### Robust Machine Translation

Neural Machine Translation (NMT) systems are known to degrade when confronted with noisy data, especially when the system is trained only on clean data. However, some types of noise are very common, in particular for low-resource languages. Handling code-switched, transliterated, or ungrammatical input is essential for deploying systems in the wild.

### Low-resource Machine Translation

There has traditionally been a significant concentration of machine translation research on a few languages - usually Indo-European. Data scarcity has hindered the progress of many languages, many with millions of speakers. Our aim is to reverse the trend by focusing on low-resource languages that have been traditionally ignored by mainstream research.

### Terminology Translation

As neural machine translation (NMT) systems become an important part of professional translator pipelines, a growing body of work focuses on combining NMT with terminologies. In many scenarios and particularly in cases of domain adaptation, one expects the MT output to adhere to the constraints provided by a terminology.

### Machine Translation Evaluation

Is it possible to build a general and automatic Machine Tranlsation evaluation metric? In terms of performance, existing metrics are either unsatisfactory or restricted to tasks where large human ratings are already available.
