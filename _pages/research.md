### Robust Machine Translation

Neural Machine Translation (NMT) systems are known to degrade when confronted with noisy data, especially when the system is trained only on clean data. However, some types of noise are very common, in particular for low-resource languages. Handling code-switched, transliterated, or ungrammatical input is essential for deploying systems in the wild.

### Low-resource Machine Translation

Neural Machine Translation (NMT) systems are known to degrade when confronted with noisy data, especially when the system is trained only on clean data. However, some types of noise are very common, in particular for low-resource languages. Handling code-switched, transliterated, or ungrammatical input is essential for deploying systems in the wild.
