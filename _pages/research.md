### Sentiment Analysis

Sentiment analysis (also known as opinion mining or emotion AI) refers to the use of natural language processing, text analysis, computational linguistics, and biometrics to systematically identify, extract, quantify, and study affective states and subjective information.

### Image Captioning

Image Captioning is the process of generating textual description of an image. It uses both Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision to generate the captions.

### Robust Machine Translation

Neural Machine Translation (NMT) systems are known to degrade when confronted with noisy data, especially when the system is trained only on clean data. However, some types of noise are very common, in particular for low-resource languages. Handling code-switched, transliterated, or ungrammatical input is essential for deploying systems in the wild.
