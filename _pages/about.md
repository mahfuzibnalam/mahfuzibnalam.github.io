Hi, I’m Md Mahfuz Ibn Alam. I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from George Mason University in July 2024, where I worked with [Antonios Anastasopoulos](https://cs.gmu.edu/~antonis/author/antonios-anastasopoulos/). Before that, I completed my M.S. in Computer Science at George Mason and my B.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering at the Islamic University of Technology in Bangladesh.

I’m now an Assistant Teaching Professor in the Department of Data Science at William & Mary. My research focuses on Natural Language Processing, especially on developing robust models for low-resource languages and dialects. In my dissertation, I introduced new methods for translating dialectal sentences, addressing the challenges of limited data and linguistic variation.

Earlier in my academic journey, I was active in competitive programming, an experience that continues to shape the way I approach problem-solving and computational challenges.

You can explore more about my work in my [CV](https://black-tori-75.tiiny.site).

Interests
======

* Natural Language Processing (NLP) – building models for low-resource and multilingual languages, translation (text-to-text, speech-to-text, text-to-speech), and large language models.

* Data Science & Teaching – designing and delivering engaging curricula, mentoring students, creating hands-on learning experiences, and applying data-driven methods to real-world problems.
