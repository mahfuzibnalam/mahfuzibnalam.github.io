My name is Md Mahfuz Ibn Alam. I am a Ph.D. candidate expecting to graduate in May 2024 from the Computer Science Department of George Mason University. My dissertation advisor is [Antonios Anastasopoulos](https://cs.gmu.edu/~antonis/author/antonios-anastasopoulos/). I have received my Masters in Computer Science from George Mason University. My Bachelor's was in Computer Science and Engineering from the Islamic University of Technology, Bangladesh.

I was a competitive programmer back in my undergrad time. I am mostly focused on creating robust models for various Natural Language processing tasks. My expertise lies especially in low-resource scenarios. I am currently in the job market looking for full-time Research Scientist or Research Engineer roles.
