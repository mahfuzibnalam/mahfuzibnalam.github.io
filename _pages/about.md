My name is Md Mahfuz Ibn Alam. Currently, I am doing my Ph.D. in Computer Science at George Mason University. Previously I studied CS (BSc) at the Islamic University of Technology, Bangladesh. I was a competitive programmer back in my undergrad time. Now I am mostly focused on creating robust models for Machine Translation. I have some expertise in working on multimodal setups like Image Captioning. I am also interested in dialogue systems and hope to work on it in the recent future.
